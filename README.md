# Simplified C Library

## Overview
In this project I have reimplemented several standard C library functions, as well as added some of my own utility functions. It is a simple, straightforward library done for educational purposes.

## Features
- **Standard C Functions**: Basic re-implementation of common C library functions.
- **Utility Functions**: Some additional functions for personal use and learning.
- **String and Memory Functions**: Functions for string and memory manipulation.
